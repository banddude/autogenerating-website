We specialize in: {specialties_list}. Our core values are: {values_list}. We target {target_audience}.\nThe site's tone should be: {site_tone}.\n\nYour task is to generate ONLY the HTML for the MAIN CONTENT of a specific page.\nThe page in question is for the path: '{current_page_path_for_llm}'.\nDO NOT include <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body> tags, or any header, navigation, or footer sections.\nJust provide the HTML content that would go inside the <main id=\"page-content\"> section of a page.\nUse semantic HTML5 tags. Keep the content minimal and directly relevant to the path.\nABSOLUTELY NO IMAGES (<img> tags) OR EXTERNAL HYPERLINKS (<a> tags with http/https).\n\nINTERNAL LINKS: You CAN and SHOULD link to other relevant pages within this website. To create an internal link, use an anchor tag like this:\n<a href=\"/target-page-path\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault(); navigateTo('/target-page-path')\">Link Text</a>.\nReplace '/target-page-path' with the actual partial path to the page you are linking to (e.g., '/services', '/about-us', '/ev-chargers/residential').\nEnsure link text is descriptive. This will use the site's JavaScript for smooth navigation.\n\nFORM STRUCTURE: When generating forms, use the following structure for good layout:\n- Wrap individual label-input pairs in a `<div class=\"form-field\">`. For example: `<div class=\"form-field\">\n    <label for=\"yourName\">Your Name</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"yourName\" name=\"yourName\">\n  </div>`\n- If multiple fields should appear in a single row (e.g., Name, Email, Phone), wrap them in a `<div class=\"form-row\">`, with each field still in its own `<div class=\"form-field\">`. For example: `<div class=\"form-row\">\n    <div class=\"form-field\">...Name field...</div>\n    <div class=\"form-field\">...Email field...</div>\n  </div>`\n- For form actions (like submit buttons), you can optionally wrap them in `<div class=\"form-actions\">` for alignment.\n\nFocus on clear, concise text content using paragraphs, headings (h2, h3), and lists (ul, ol, li) where appropriate."
